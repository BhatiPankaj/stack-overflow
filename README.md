# An Android Stack Overflow Questions App uses the last technologies and methodologies recommended by Google:

- Integrated the Stack Overflow APIs to fetch and display questions and answers in real-time.
- Used the latest Jetpack libraries such as ViewModel, LiveData, Room, Navigation Component, and Paging 3 for efficient, modular, and maintainable architecture.
- Developed the UI using Jetpack Compose, demonstrating proficiency with the latest Android UI toolkit for building declarative user interfaces.
- Implemented MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and Clean Architecture patterns to separate concerns and improve the testability, maintainability, and scalability of the app.
- Implemented a search feature allowing users to query Stack Overflow questions.
- Utilized Paging 3 for efficient data loading and pagination, ensuring smooth scrolling and resource management in lists of questions and answers.
- Employed Room database to cache question and answer data for offline viewing, improving the user experience during connectivity interruptions.
- Used Retrofit with Kotlin Coroutines and Flow to handle network requests in an asynchronous and non-blocking manner, ensuring seamless data fetching.
- Followed modern Android development practices such as Dependency Injection with Hilt, material design principles, and responsive layouts.
- Wrote unit tests for ViewModels and repository layers, as well as UI tests for Compose components using JUnit and Espresso, ensuring a robust and bug-free app.
